            "I LOVE this White Chicken Chili! You are right, it is satiating meal—delicious with toasted bread. Refreshingly different taste than any chicken chili I’ve made in the past. I made it exactly as written and added some chopped zucchini, carrots, and celery. Instead of shredding the chicken, I chopped it into small pieces. It freezes very well. Will be an all-time favorite, for sure.",
